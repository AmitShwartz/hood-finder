We @venn are transforming neighborhoods by connecting neighbors, supporting local businesses and helping residents get more actively involved with their communities.
We need you to help us find our next locations!
Before entering a neighborhood we first analyze whether it'd be a good match for our activity â€” we look at things like: resident distributions of age, occupations, average income, etc.; distance from city-center; availability of public transportation and many other parameters.

To commence the setup process,  follow the steps outlined below:

1. Execute the command: 
   ```
   yarn install
   ```
   or 
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```
   or
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure your development environment for iOS or Android by referring to the guidelines provided in the following link: [React Native Environment Setup Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native).

3. Initiate the development server by running the command:
   ```
   yarn start
   ```

4. Depending on your chosen platform in step 2, execute either of the following commands:
   ```
   yarn ios
   ```
   or
   ```
   yarn android
   ```

These steps will ensure the proper setup and initiation of your React Native development environment.
